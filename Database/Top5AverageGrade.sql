/*You're doing research about academic achievement, and you're studying one particular group of students at a local university. Find the average grade of the five most successful students in this group.

The information about the students' grades is stored in a table called students, which has the following attributes:

student_id: the unique identifier of the student;
student_name: the name of the student;
grade: the grade that the student achieved.
Your task is to write a select statement which outputs one column average_grade and one row that contains the average grade of the five students with the highest grades. The answer should be formatted to 2 digits after the decimal point. It is guaranteed that the five most successful students can be uniquely identified.

Example

For the following table students

student_id	student_name	grade
1	Oliver Smith	3.2
2	Jacob Bell	2.9
3	William Thompson	3.1
4	Sophie Clark	3.5
5	Daniel Palmer	3.6
6	Emily Morris	4.0
7	Zachary Mills	2.5
the output should be

average_grade
3.48*/
