/*You are curious about the geographical distribution of CodeSignal users, so you have created a list of countries along with the number of registered users from each. Your task now is to calculate the number of users on each continent.

The information about the countries is stored in a table countries, which has 3 columns:

country: the name of the country;
continent: the name of the continent where the country is located;
users: the number of users registered on CodeSignal in the country.
The answer should be a table with 2 columns, continent and users, sorted by the number of users in decreasing order.

Example

For the following table countries

country	continent	users
Armenia	Europe	1000
France	Europe	1300
Russia	Europe	3000
USA	North America	5000
the resulting table should be

continent	users
Europe	5300
North America	5000

BEGIN
	/* Write your SQL here. Terminate each statement with a semicolon. */
	SELECT continent, SUM(users) as users
    FROM countries
    GROUP BY continent
    ORDER BY users DESC;
