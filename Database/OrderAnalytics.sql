You're working in a big delivery company that has to handle a lot of orders.

The information about all orders is stored in the table orders. Here is its structure:

id: unique order id;
order_date: order date (having DATE type) in the format YYYY-MM-DD;
type: the type of the product in the order;
quantity: the quantity of the product in the order;
price: the price of one item of the product.
In order to get a better view of your data you decided to create a new table called orders_analytics. It should contain the same orders as the orders and consist of the following columns:

id: order id;
year: the year of the order;
quarter: the quarter of the year in which the order was taken;
type: the type of the product in the order;
total_price: the total price of the order (total_price = price * quantity).
The quarter of the year is defined as follows:

01 January till 31 March refers to the 1st quarter;
01 April till 30 June refers to the 2nd quarter;
01 July till 30 September refers to the 3rd quarter;
01 October till 31 December refers to the 4th quarter.
Given the table orders, build the new table order_analytics and print all its rows ordered by order ids.

Example

For the following table orders

id	order_date	type	quantity	price
1	2015-08-15	Pizza	2	25
2	2016-05-11	Sushi	1	37
3	2015-01-01	Wok	5	8
4	2016-12-31	Cake	1	49
the output should be

id	year	quarter	type	total_price
1	2015	3	Pizza	50
2	2016	2	Sushi	37
3	2015	1	Wok	40
4	2016	4	Cake	49
